I'm Arno, a 30-years old civil-servant, philosopher and generalist geek. 

I live in Ghent, Belgium, where I was born. I grew up outside of town but returned here to study philosophy at the university and stayed here. I love this city with it's exciting blend of history, culture and social life. On my days off, chances are you find me somehwere in a coffee bar writing, reading or debating friends, or walking around town with my camera. During working hours I'm an administrative expert for the Belgian federal social security.

During my university studies I specialized in ethics, political philosophy, critical philosophy and social commentary. I wrote my [masters dissertation](/files/thesis.pdf) (pdf in Dutch) on universal basic income and libertarianism; a subject about which I'm still very passionate.

I have a broad range of interests that I like to explore. That's what this blog is for, both a personal project and the means to share these interests with the world.
