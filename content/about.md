Hi, my name is Arno. I'm an 20-something civil-servant, philosopher and geek.
This is my personal website, to use as I see fit.

I live in Ghent, Belgium. I was born there, but grew up outside of town. When I started to study philosophy in university, I moved here permanently. I love this city, with it's great mix of history, culture and social life. Chances are, you can find me on days off somewhere in a hipster coffee bar having discussions with friends, reading a book or typing stuff on my laptop. On working days, I'm an administrative expert for the Belgian federal social security. 

I got my masters degree in philosophy and wrote about universal basic income (UBI) and libertarianism - you can read more about that [here](/categories/basic-income/). My interests lie in ethics, political philosophy, critical philosophy and social commentary. 

A lot of the time, I'm walking around with a camera with me and I consider myself somewhat as a amateur photographer. I have been taking pictures regularly and sharing them with friends for at least ten years. I used to host a photo blog on one of the well-known commercial websites, but since they changed their policy to be more restrictive and puritan, I decided to move on. So you'll find a section dedicated to my [photography](/) here, both film and digital.

But in the end, I'd like to think of myself as a generalist. I find it difficult to describe myself in, or limit myself to, just a few things. You'll notice that [my blog](/blog) is a hodge-podge of different subjects. I try to write about many different things that interest me or that I care about. [Books](/books), [life](/timeline), [politics](/categories/politics/), typewriters, [games](/games), history, [movies](/movies), weird stuff,...

Should you want to contact me, my e-mail adress is `arno.vandenhende`<span style="display: none;">REMOVE</span>`@posteo.net`.
