I'm Arno, a 32-years old civil-servant, philosopher and generalist geek.

I live in Ghent, Belgium, where I was born. I grew up outside of town but returned here to study philosophy at the university and stayed here. I love this city with it's exciting blend of history, culture and social life. On my days off, chances are you find me somehwere in a coffee bar writing, reading or debating friends, or walking around town with my camera. During working hours I'm a civil servant for the Belgian federal administration.

During my university studies I specialized in ethics, political philosophy, critical philosophy and social commentary. I wrote my [masters dissertation](/files/thesis.pdf) (in Dutch, 549 kB PDF) on universal basic income and libertarianism; a subject about which I'm still very passionate.

I have a broad range of interests that I like to explore. That's what this blog is for, both a personal project and the means to share these interests with the world. I am a bibliophile, collector of art and curiosities and father to two adorable cats: Rops and Alma.
