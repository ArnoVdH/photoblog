My name is Arno Van den Hende. I live in Ghent, Belgium.

I have a Master of Art in philosophy, specifically political philosophy.

I'm a generalist and enthusiast of a whole range of subjects, among them photography.

That's the *raison d'Ãªtre* of this site: to serve as a informal portfolio of my amateur photography and a place to write about the things on my mind.

Should you want to contact me, my e-mail adress is `arno.vandenhende`<span style="display: none;">REMOVE</span>`@posteo.net`.
