### 1.0.1 (2020-07-12)
* Because of some wonky mergers done through another computer I lost most of my work since june. I had to revert and restore an older version. It's possible that some older issues were 'restored' with it.

* Reorganized the static/img folder and matching links

### 0.9.12 (2020-06-25)
* Rewrote the CSS stylesheet from scratch (unfortunately this did *not* make it easier to fix my original problem)

* Moved the logotype AVdH outside of the `<header>` scope

### 0.9.11 (2020-06-24)

* Removed all single photoblog pages
* Compressed all photoblog images an additional Â±45% in size

### 0.9.9 (2020-06-17)
* Added a render hook to make images lazy-loading. Code taken from [here](https://nickmchardy.com/2020/05/adding-lazy-loading-for-images-in-hugo-static-site-generator.html)
* added a _markup folder

### 0.9.8 (2020-04-25)
