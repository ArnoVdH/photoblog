Since I'm using multiple devices, programs, projects, etc, I'm starting to get in need (or at least want) for a coherent naming scheme.

### Ideas
Alphabetical progression?

- Greek letters? (kinda confusing with development stages)
- Personal Names? (philosophers?)
- Stars & Planets? (sure..?)
- Chemical elements? (meh)
- Alchemical elements (hmmmmm)
- Republican calendar?
- Necromantic elements? (blood, bone,...)
- Weird stuff? (mythos, ...)
- Strange concepts

### List

1. Desktop computer: 
2. Primary laptop: 
3. Secondary laptop: 
4. Notebook: 
5. Smartphone: 
6. Raspberry Pi:
