Since I'm using multiple devices, programs, projects, etc, I'm starting to get in need for a coherent naming scheme.

### Ideas
Alphabetical progression?

- Greek letters? (kinda confusing with development stages)
- Personal Names? (philosophers?)
- Stars & Planets? (sure..?)
- Republican calendar?
- Necromantic elements? (blood, bone,...)

### List
