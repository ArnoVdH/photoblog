It started out as an idea to have my own place on the internet.  

**Goal: a clean, light website that functions as both a photo portfolio and a personal blog. Building it myself would be an added bonus.**

Early 2019: exploring possibilities
-----------------------------------

I don't have any background in graphic or web design or programming. Building my own website is a personal challenge and learning experience 

I started by researching a bit generally about webdesign, html & css (internetting is not hard and other guides). 

At first I looked into building with wordpress. 

But it seemed cumbersome. A friend told me about looking into static website generators and he himself was dabbling with Jekyll. When researching this I found Hugo and decided to try it out since it's simplicity. 

Summer 2019: Building with Hugo
-------------------------------

In early july I built my hugo setup on a laptop with Lubuntu, VS Code and GitHub. 

After some tinkering with other theme's and trying to figure out how everything connected, I decided to build my own theme from the ground up.  

Funfact: I'm writing this blogpost while I'm still building the website. I literally have just a basic skeleton of the site and I'm starting to get a feel for the whole thing. Things are becoming clearer and specific issues are being identified. Progress at last! It makes me happy.
