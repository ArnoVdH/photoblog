The blog should be my own representation on the web, seperate from the corporate interpretations of identity in the form of a profile-page. I want to have full-control, even if that means it's more difficult to show things like I want them.

It's where I want to share my main creations: photo's and written thoughts, free from puritan censorship as practices by most tech-companies. I decide for myself.

Ideally, these are presented cleanly, simple and uniform. Inspiration for this is the modernist movement of the twenties in Western Europe (think Tschichold and Bauhaus). Clear background, readable text, the right amount of information. Not overly baroque, no unnecessary embellishments, all decoration in function of readability.

Most importantly, I want to built it myself.
