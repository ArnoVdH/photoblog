Since I'm applying to get sterilized soon, I thought I'd write about my "childfree wish" and my vision on the ethics and philosophical justifications of (not) having children.

## Critiques

Selfish

You'll change your mind yet

What about your girlfriend

It's so special and unique

You'll regret not having them

Who takes care of you when you're older?

It's your purpose in life.

## Reasons

There are multiple reasons I don't want any children, but I think that any one of them would be sufficient to accept my decision. Better yet: I'd argue that the choice to _have_ children should be an active one requiring introspection and argumentation.

Self-deterrmination and reproductive health.

### Personal

I don't like children.

I think I don't have enough time or money as it is.

### Ecological

A child is an extra human being that consumes and pollutes.

Overpopulation isn't a Malthusian problem, it's a pollution problem.

### Responsibility

It's a heavy responsibility that I'm not sure I want or can bear.

I'd be afraid to make important mistakes when raising a child.

What if there's something wrong with the child?

### Existential & the value of life

It's not just caring for a child, but also being responsible for the fact of its existence, it's experiences, anxieties, etc.

Life is at best morally neutral.

The horrors of life.

I'm not an antinatalist.

### Reasons for having children

All this is not to say that I'm against having children per se. I think that it's certainly possible to justify having them.

Christine Overall, in het 2005? work "Why Have Children?", analyses the more common arguments for having children and dismisses most of them. She does argue for something.
