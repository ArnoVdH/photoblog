These last few years we see the idea of a (universal) basic income mentioned. It's not all over the news, but it's certainly something you've probably heard mentioning somewhere or read in passing. Not daily, but once in a while. In a thinkpiece somewhere probably, and probably by someone *progressive*. It's a fascinating idea that makes you think. Some people are revolted by it, others think it's a panacea to all society's problems. It's a lot more nuanced of course, but it's worth delving into.

Back in 2015 I wrote [my master's thesis](/files/thesis.pdf) on the subject of basic income and libertarianism. Ever since I've wanted to translate and maybe expand a little on the work I did, and share it with the world. This post is based on the first chapter.

In this blogpost I will try to define and describe what a basic income could (and maybe should) be. What is and isn't a basic income, what some of the intended effects would be and some basic criticisms leveled against it. In a later blogpost I'd like to go deeper into the history of the idea.

What is a basic income?
-----------------------

First of all I should elaborate a little on the term 'basic income'. In the past, there have been different names for this idea, as it has been repeatedly and independently been argued for over the course of the last 200 years. Other names include 'social dividend', 'state bonus', 'citizen's wage' and multiple variations on these. (Universal) basic income often gets abbreviated to UBI or BI.

I'll start by giving a working definition of what I think a universal basic income is. I'm aware that this definition will be contentious, but I hope to make clear that these different elements are helpfull in differentiating between what is and what isn't a BI and between different interpretations of BI proposals.

>A basic income is an income, payed to all individual residents of a political community, unconditionally and sufficiently high for a humane existence.

Lets look a little deeper into the constituting elements of the definition and bring some of them into sharper focus.

### Income
First the obvious: a basic income is an *income*. This means that it's a *monetary* payment, and not a payment in kind. This is because money can be exchanged easily and universally for other goods and services. Unlike, for instance, vouchers (as proposed by Milton Friedman) that can only be exchanged for a defined good (food, education, and so on). Money gives more options and freedom to the individual in question, although they could act complimentary.

Besides that, it also implies that the income gets payed *regularly*, be it weekly, monthly, years or something else. In other words: it's not a one-time thing or a privilege that's been extended by a benevolent government, but something that can be relied on.

### Individual
It's important to stress the individual as the basic unit to think about. The basic income is payed out to any single individual resident of a given community (see below) and not the (head of) a family or another configuration of people. The composition of the family isn't taken into account, in contrast to a subsistence income where people living together get less per capita since living costs get lower when living with two (or more).

In principle the basic income shouldn't vary with any parameter (see unconditionality, below) except, practically, maybe with age, depending on the implementation of the basic income. For instance, it could be argued that older people need a little more because of rising medical costs and maybe it's complemented with an existing basic pension that's already in place. None the less, the basic income shouldn't prevent people from working longer if they are so inclined.

### Community
Residents of a political community.

### Unconditional
No means test, etc

### High enough
Above the poverty line.

### Things left out
Children, punishments (should prisoners get their BI?), the issue of citizenship, disability...

Variations on BI
----------------

### Negative income tax

### Stakeholder grants

### Participation income

### Existing forms of BI-like systems
Child benefits, some old age pensions, alaska fund

Why a BI?
---------

### Overhead and the nanny state

### Unemployment trap

### Poverty

### Communality

### Human rights and human decency

### Ecology and quality of life

### Autonomy, power and alternatives

### Redress

Possible problems with a BI
---------------------------

### Cost and financing

### Globalisation and migration

### Laziness

### Bad actors, the wrong reasons

### Individualism
