These last few years we see the idea of a (universal) basic income mentioned. It's not all over the news, but it's certainly something you've probably heard mentioning somewhere or read in passing. Not daily, but once in a while. In a thinkpiece somewhere probably, and probably by someone *progressive*. It's a fascinating idea that makes you think. Some people are revolted by it, others think it's a panacea to all society's problems. It's a lot more nuanced of course, but it's worth delving into.

Back in 2015 I wrote my master's thesis on the subject of basic income and libertarianism. Ever since I've wanted to translate and maybe expand a little on the work I did, and share it with the world.

In this blogpost I will try to define and describe what a basic income could (and maybe should) be. What is and isn't a basic income. What some of the intended effects would be and some basic criticisms leveled against it. In a later blogpost I'd like to go deeper into the history of the idea.
