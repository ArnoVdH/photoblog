These last few years we see the idea of a (universal) basic income mentioned. It's not all over the news, but it's certainly something you've probably heard mentioning somewhere or read in passing. Not daily, but once in a while. In a thinkpiece somewhere probably, and probably by someone *progressive*. It's a fascinating idea that makes you think. Some people are revolted by it, others think it's a panacea to all society's problems. It's a lot more nuanced of course, but it's worth delving into.

Back in 2015 I wrote [my master's thesis](/files/thesis.pdf) on the subject of basic income and libertarianism. Ever since I've wanted to translate and maybe expand a little on the work I did, and share it with the world.

In this blogpost I will try to define and describe what a basic income could (and maybe should) be. What is and isn't a basic income. What some of the intended effects would be and some basic criticisms leveled against it. In a later blogpost I'd like to go deeper into the history of the idea.

What is a basic income?
-----------------------

First of all I should elaborate a little on the term 'basic income'. In the past, there have been different names for this idea, as it has been repeatedly and independently been argued for over the course of the last 200 years. Other names include 'social dividend', 'state bonus', 'citizen's wage' and multiple variations on these. (Universal) basic income often gets abbreviated to UBI or BI.

I'll start by giving a working definition of what I think a universal basic income is. I'm aware that this definition will be contentious, but I hope to make clear that these different elements are helpfull in differentiating between what is and what isn't a BI and between different interpretations of BI proposals.

>A basic income is an income, payed to all individual residents of a political community, unconditionally and sufficiently high for a humane existence.
