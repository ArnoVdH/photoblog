**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

The Lighthouse is Robert Eggers' newest film, after the 18th century psychological horror masterpiece movie The VVitch. This film too is a meticulously put together work of art, with a fabulous dual cast of Daniel Dafoe and Robert Pattinson (trivia: this is the first time I saw a movie with Pattinson), bombastic dialogues, great visuals and the best Lovecraftian atmosphere I've seen in a long time.

The premise of the movie is simple: two men have to maintain the lighthouse together for four weeks. Of course, lighthouskeeper isn't a job that attracts so-called 'normal people', so our two characters are at odds with each other and the only thing they have in common initially is their facial hair. The old man is grumpy, shows a weird possessiveness about the light in the tower and likes to pull rank as the senior 'wickie' (the nickname for lighthouse keepers) on the barren island and keeps giving young Pattinson's character lot's of tiresome chores to do. The young man is the silent type, seemingly carrying a troublesome past. This leads to a few conflicts between the two men during their stay on the desolate rock. But when at the end of their mission the weather turns from bad to worse, the two men descend into drink and into madness.

Themes

Acting

While this is a horror movie in the classical sense, it's not bereft of humor. There are lots of small moments and scenes that lighten to otherwise bleak mood. Daniel Dafoe farting regularly certainly makes it difficult to experience even this grim movie as depressing. But it's more than just toilet humor; many of the interactions between the two men, especially when drunk, become amusing and confusing; and there are absurd moments that elicit laughter from some type of people that include myself.

Sound: the foghorn, the water, the dripping. The accents.

And keeping the best for last: the cinematography is superb. The movie was shot on 35mm black and white film (more specifically Kodak Double-X 5222 film), with old lenses and cyan filters, and shot in an almost rectangular (1.19:1) format used in some old movies. This combines to give the movie a gritty, claustrophobic look. But Eggers makes beautiful use of its restrictions (and thus its possibilities). There are both high-contrast scenes that convey the highly dramatic tension, as low contrast scenes that help to establish the lonely, abandoned mood, such as the ship appearing (and disappearing) in the mist. There's even a scene where the manipulation of the film is used, by means of (pseudo-)solarization.

Robert Eggers is making his name as a preeminent director of quality horror these days, and I'm curious about what he'll make for us in the future. Be sure to give this one a viewing, it's worth it.
