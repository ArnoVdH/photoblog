Can you trust a paranoid schizophrenic to tell a _real_ ghost story?

Kiernan manages to vividly and convincingly sketch the inner life of someone with mental health problems. 

The narrative is not linear, everchanging and difficult to trace, even by the narrator.

Imp struggles herself with notions of truth, facts, falsehoods and lies.

There are two short-stories, written by the narrator, embedded in this story that could much function on their own. I especially liked (the one about fecunda ratis).

Different strands of stories, themes and possible hauntings are interwoven throughout the story. It's about the destructive impression that art can make upon one's life. About meeting a person twice for the first time. About a mermaid and a terrible wolf. About infatuation with an idea and the horrible consequences wrought upon its victim. About the past, hereditary predestination and about the sea. It's mainly beautiful and touching though.
