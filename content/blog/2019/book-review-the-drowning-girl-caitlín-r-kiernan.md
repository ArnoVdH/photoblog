Can you trust a paranoid schizophrenic to tell a _real_ ghost story?

Published in 2012, this weird gothic horror story is a psychological labyrinth that starts of slow, but completely mesmerizes you by  the time you get to the really weird stuff. Kiernan manages to vividly and convincingly sketch the inner life of someone with a mental illness, without any prejudice.

The novel is written as a memoir by India Morgan Phelps, shortened to Imp. She tries to recall the events that happened before. How she met and consequently lost her lover Abalyn. She reminisces on a painting she saw when she was young, called "The Drowning Girl" by the (fictitious) 19th century artist Phillip George Saltonstall. What the role is of her meeting a woman called Eva for the first time twice - once in July and once in November - in the break-up.

The narrative is not linear, it's ever changing and difficult to trace, even by the narrator. Imp struggles herself with notions of truth, facts, falsehoods and lies. There are things she remembers as happening, while she also recognizes that they contradict with earlier statements. We read along with her while she tries to grapple with these inconsistencies and her understanding of her own madness.

Different strands of stories, themes and possible hauntings are interwoven throughout the story. It's about the destructive impression that art can make upon one's life. About meeting a person twice for the first time. About a lost mermaid and a terrible wolf. About infatuation with an idea and the horrible consequences wrought upon its victim. About the past, hereditary predestination and about the sea.

There are two short-stories, written by the narrator, embedded in this story that could much function on their own. I especially liked the one about Albert Perrault as a sinister (and also fictitious) painter transforming a woman into art.

It's beautiful. But it needs to get worse before it gets _weird_.
