These last few years we see the idea of a (universal) basic income mentioned. It's not all over the news, but it's certainly something you've probably heard mentioning somewhere or read in passing. Not daily, but once in a while. In a thinkpiece somewhere probably, and probably by someone *progressive*. 

In this blogpost I want to define and describe what a basic income could (and maybe should) be. In a later blogpost I'd like to go deeper into the history of the idea.
