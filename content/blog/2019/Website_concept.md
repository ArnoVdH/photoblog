The blog should be my own representation on the web, seperate from the corporate interpretations of identity in the form of a profile-page.

It's where I want to share my main creations: photo's and written thoughts.

Ideally, these are presented cleanly, simple and uniform. Inspiration for this is the modernist movement of the twenties in Western Europe (think Tschichold and Bauhaus). Clear background, readable text, the right amount of information. Not overly baroque, no unnecessary embellishments, all decoration in function of readability.

Most importantly, I want to built it myself.
