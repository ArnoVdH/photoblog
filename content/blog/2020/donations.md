The coming year I want to give a monthly donation[^1] to projects, creators[^2] and organizations that I think are worthwhile, changing the recipient every month. I do this because supporting multiple projects continuously is difficult. The costs quickly adds up so that it's difficult to give support to the wide range of the deserving.

And since I'm a dork who's enamoured with the French Revolution, I'm using the [French Republican calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar) for this. This has the added benefit that it starts in September, thus the end of the month coincides more or less with the beginning of this experiment.

I don't intend this as a performative act, a judgement towards others or a way to profile myself as morally superior. It's just me sharing something I care about and that's deserving of attention and support in any way.

Any suggestions for worthwhile projects are welcome!

## The List[^3]

**Who?** [The Document Foundation](https://www.documentfoundation.org/), the non-profit organization that develops **[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)**, a free/libre open-source office suite.

**Why?** I've been using LibreOffice for some years now, and OpenOffice before that (of which LibreOffice is a fork). The OpenOffice project has become irrelevant since the acquirement by Apache, but LibreOffice is very much an active and thriving project. I started using it somewhere in 2013 when writing my master thesis and have been very happy with it.

## Charity versus donations
I wouldn't be me if I didn't ponder a little on this decision of mine.

I have a deep aversion towards charity (the Christian *caritas*), because it originates in a patronizing attitude and tacitly accepting an unjust society. That is to say, in a just society there would be no need for charity. Doesn't this make me a hypocrite then?

I don't think it necessarily has to be. I won't be donating to institutionilized charities or NGOs but directly to the people intended, some of whom do their thing regardless of my donations and often free of charge too. It's not a patronizing stance but one of support and encouragement.

[^1]: For personal reasons I won't disclose the amount I'm donating, only the recipient.
[^2]: For artists I'm planning to order artwork or merchandise as a way to support them.
