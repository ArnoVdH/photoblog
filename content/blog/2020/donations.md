The coming year I want to give a monthly donation[^1] to projects, creators[^2] and organizations that I think are worthwhile, changing the recipient every month. I do this because supporting multiple projects continuously is difficult. The costs quickly adds up so that it's difficult to give support to the wide range of the deserving.

And since I'm a dork who's enamoured with the French Revolution, I'm using the [French Republican calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar) for this. This has the added benefit that it starts in September, thus the end of the month coincides more or less with the beginning of this experiment.

I don't intend this as a performative act, a judgement towards others or a way to profile myself as morally superior. It's just me sharing something I care about and that's deserving of attention and support in any way.

Any suggestions for worthwhile projects are welcome!

## The List[^3]
### Vendémiaire
**Who?** [The Document Foundation](https://www.documentfoundation.org/), the non-profit organization that develops **[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)**, a free/libre open-source office suite.

**Why?** I've been using LibreOffice for some years now, and OpenOffice before that (of which LibreOffice is a fork). The OpenOffice project has become irrelevant since the acquirement by Apache, but LibreOffice is very much an active and thriving project. I started using it somewhere in 2013 when writing my master thesis and have been very happy with it.

### Brumaire
**Who?** [Kat Zoekt Thuis](https://www.katzoektthuis.be/) is an organization that acts as a network of foster families for stray cats and kittens. They operate mainly in the region of Ghent and Brugers.

**Why?** [Our two cats](/img/rops_alma.jpg) are adopted through them and are such a wonderful addition to our lives. But the organization works through gifts and voltuneers and doesn't receive any subsidies. Since we can't help on a practical level, I decided to help them a little financially. 

### Frimaire
**Who?** [Apollonia Saintclair](https://apolloniasaintclair.com/) is a Swiss artist of erotic - and often weird - art. 

**Why?** I've been following her work since my early Tumblr days. Finally being able to get one of her works, as a present for my girlfriend, it felt good to show some support for someone I've been enjoying for this long.

### Nivôse
**Who?** The [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/) is the non-profit organization supporting, funding and hosting a whole host of Wikimedia projects, of which [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) is the largest and most well-known.

**Why?** Wikipedia turns 20 and has been a huge resource for people of my generation - think of all the school projects that used it! - and for me personally. About almost any subject I could think of there's a page for me to read and find further sources (something I do more as I get older). All these years I've more or less taken its existence for granted. This has changed now and I'm happy to contribute a little financially to this beautiful project.

### Pluviôse

### Ventôse

### Germinal

### Floréal

### Prairial

### Messidor

### Thermidor

### Fructidor

## Charity versus donations
I wouldn't be me if I didn't ponder a little on this decision of mine.

I have a deep aversion towards charity (the Christian *caritas*), because it originates in a patronizing attitude and tacitly accepting an unjust society. That is to say, in a just society there would be no need for charity. Doesn't this make me a hypocrite then?

I don't think it necessarily has to be. I won't be donating to institutionilized charities or NGOs but directly to the people intended, some of whom do their thing regardless of my donations and often free of charge too. It's not a patronizing stance but one of support and encouragement.

[^1]: For personal reasons I won't disclose the amount I'm donating, only the recipient.
[^2]: For artists I'm planning to order artwork or merchandise as a way to support them.
