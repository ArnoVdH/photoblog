There is a presupposition that, as a white cishet male (all the words!) trying to acknowledge his *privileges*, I must be utterly miserable and emasculated by the experience. Full of self-hate and constantly apolizing; digging myself deeper, groveling before the relevant opressed demographic. Castigating myself and my 'fellow people' before the altar of the false god of *political correctness*. This is simply not true in my experience, which I'll try to explain here.

I wrote this post while reading the book 'Why I No Longer Talk to White People About Race' by [Reni Eddo-Lodge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reni_Eddo-Lodge). I am aware how un-asked for it is for yet another white person to write about these issues, but I hope that I can make clear that it's not about the issue of 'privilege' itself but the perception of it by the hegemonic demographics as somehow harmful, and how to live a normal, healthy life while being aware.

### From equality to awereness
I find myself at the crossroads of a lot of different privileges: I'm white, I'm a man, I'm straight, I'm not an immigrant, I have a university degree, a middle-class job. That last one is probably the only thing that I could claim is something I have experienced being less privileged in: I come from a working-class background and class-consciousness (and the accompanying analyses and viewpoints) is very important to me. This is probably one of the contributing factors in why *inequality* is something that gets my blood boiling and I'm quite a bit less interested in some other intersections of privilege. Incidentally, the other big reason why inequality is so important to me, namely my professional background as a political philosopher interested in distributive justice, is probably, if I'm really honest with myself, also determined by the class-consciousness. There is some, if not circularity, then at least some sort of weird loop at play here.

But, at least it doesn't end there. My own personal passions - or more correctly: my class-interests - for radical liberty and (even more radical) equality were important for the formation of some of my ideas on other subjects as well, even if maybe just on paper. Some things were more important to me then others (and can one blame someone for their progress being directed at limited issues at a time?). What started as indignation against economic inequality led to indignation about gender equality and the inherent sexism in our society. Class, as a marxist concept, came sneaking into my thoughts as well and then a (admitattely still very limited) awereness of heteronormativity and LGBTQ+ issues. And throughout all this, racism has been something I thought I was always very clear about. A lesson: your awareness is probably still limited, even after a big *aha erlebnis*. I guess you could call me an apprentice-intersectionalist.

### What does it mean to be aware of privilege?
Realize and accept that you have biases and ideas that have been formed and influenced by privilege.

Accept that unprivileged people experience things differently, even if it's not immediately visible.

Be prepared to listen to someone when they point out your privilege, bias or faux-pas.

Apologize when necessary: this has *nothing* to do with the whole concept but is just basic human decency, like you would apologize to a friend when forgetting their birthday.

It's a learning experience. Just keep doing you and change when you do something that's not cool, radical or groovy. But practically I don't really use these concepts all that much in my daily talk. Only when something relevant should pop up I try to give some pushback by trying to point out 

### Cucked by feminazi SJW's!


### What comes after a moment of realization?
The thing is not to care too much about yourself.

Actually, as a man, becoming more aware of your own privilege is also a way towards a more healthy masculinity. I'm a lot less bothered by things people think or say about me but I am bewildered by how much it bothers

In the end I still think that class is, to me, a central concept in the way I think about how our world functions, but the other intersections are equally as important to get a full grasp of how power operates and how it keeps people from uniting in their class interests, each having their own important contribution of continuing the domineering capitalist system.
