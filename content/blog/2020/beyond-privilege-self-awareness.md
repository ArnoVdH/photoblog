+++
There is a presupposition that, as a white cishet male trying to acknowledge his privileges, I must be utterly miserable and emasculated by the experience. Full of self-hate and constantly apolizing; digging myself deeper, groveling before the relevant opressed demographic. Castigating myself and my 'fellow people' before the altar of the false god of political correctness.

### From equality to awereness

I guess you could call me intersectionalist, since I find myself at the intersection of a lot of different privileges: I'm white, I'm a man, I'm straight, I'm not an immigrant, I have a university degree, a middle-class job. That last one is probably the only thing that I could claim is something I'm knowledgable of: I come from a working-class background and class-consciousness (and the accompanying analyses and viewpoints) is very important to me. This is probably one of the contributing factors in why _inequality_ is something that gets my blood boiling and I'm quite a bit less interesting in some other intersections of privilege. Incidentally, the other big reason why inequality is so important to me, namely my professional background as a political philosopher interested in distributive justice, is probably, if I'm really honest with myself, also determined by the class-consciousness. There is some, if not circularity, then at least some sort of weird loop at play here.

Although: my own personal passions - or more correctly: my class-interests - for radical liberty and (even more radical) equality were important for the formation of some of my ideas on other subjects as well, if maybe just on paper. Some things were more important to me then others (and can one blame someone for their progress being directed at limited issues at a time?). What started as indignation against economic inequality led to indignation about gender equality and the inherent sexism in our society. Class came sneaking into my thoughts as well and then a (admitattely still very limited) awereness of heteronormativity and LGBTQ+ issues. And throughout all this, racism has been something I thought I was always very clear about. A lesson: your awareness is probably still limited, even after a big aha-erlebnis.

### What does it mean to be self-aware?

blabla

### What comes after a moment of realization?

The thing is not to care too much about yourself.

Actually, as a man, becoming more aware of your own privilege is also a way towards a more healthy masculinity. I'm a lot less bothered by things people think or say about me but I am bewildered by how much it bothers 

In the end I still think that class is, to me, a central concept in the way I think about how our world functions, but the other intersections are equally as important to get a full grasp of how power operates and how it keeps people from uniting in their class interests, each having their own important contribution of continuing the domineering capitalist system.
