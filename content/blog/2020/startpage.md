My current little project is to build a simple, cohesive start page to use as starting point for the internet. One of the reasons is that I still want to break free from the corporate algorithms deciding what I see online and thus influence how and what I'll discover and visit.

It's not that big of an idea and there's a small scene online of people designing these, inspiring me to do the same. It will involve mainly some webdesign in HTML and CSS, which I understand a little by now, and probably some JavaScript, which I don't know at all.

Some of the goals I have for the startpage:
* Sober layout. I like the 'terminal' style because it also communicates the self-reliance idea into your browser. And it looks cool, damn it!
* A comprehensive collection of my most used sites for easy access
* A functional search bar, preferably with some sort of autocomplete function
* An RSS reader: a portion of the screen that show me the top 10 stories or something. Implementation of the reader is more important right now than getting a useable feed, that would be done externally anyway.
* Hosted on github and synched on my cloud drive so I can use it on all my devices.
