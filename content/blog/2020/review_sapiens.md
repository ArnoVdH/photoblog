Yuval Noah Harari's 2011 book is a summary of the Common Man's Common Sense worldview: inconspicuous in it's ideas, making it the ideal 'intellectual' best-seller.

The first part, about our species _Homo Sapiens_ evolving and living besides other humans, Neanderthals and _Homo Erectus_ specifically, was interesting insofar it makes you aware of that fact, but doesn't draw any remotely interesting conclusions. His view on what sets the _Sapiens_ (as he call us during the whole book, a nice enough gimmick I guess) apart from animals and even from the other hominids is severely lacking in substance. His thesis is that we Sapiens have the ability to share information about things that are _not real_ and hints that this has something to do with language. But no coherent idea on how or why our language does things differently than the communication of other species. Ultimately, it's a very evolutionistic view on the basis of culture that, while certainly not unscientific, lacks the depth and nuance (or even the possibility of depth and nuance) a history of the genesis of culture probably needs. A Neanderthal wouldn't be capable of certain complex cognitive functioning and a Sapiens would have, and at the same level - more or less - as contemporary humans, but he offers no real evidence of it. And ultimately, that is what evolutionary stories will always be: plausible yet uncertain what-if stories.

The second part about the agricultural revolution.

The third part is about the progression of history towards some sort of unification.

The fourth part is about the scientific revolution and modernity.

Modern-day eugenics.

His worldview is, ultimately, a very simplistic one, mainly meant to be acceptable to a broad swath of readers that view themselves as intelligent, without being intellectual snobs. Nothing is revealed to the big public, no grand new ideas or theories, no bold claims or even appeals to action.

One thing I'll give Harari: he mentions regularly the fact that culture or society, even in our modern times, don't necessarily make for a better, more fulfilled life. He never says so explicitly, but he at least implies that a better life should be possible.
