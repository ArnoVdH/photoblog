A summary of the Common Man's Common Sense worldview.

<!--more-->

The first part about our species *Homo Sapiens* evolving and living besides other humans, Neanderthals and *Homo Erectus* specifically, was interesting insofar it makes you aware of that fact, but doesn't draw any remotely interesting conclusions. His view on what sets the *Sapiens* (as he call us during the whole book, a nice enough gimmick I guess) apart from animals and even from the other hominids is severy lacking in substance. His thesis is that we Sapiens have the ability to share information about things that are *not real* and hints that this has something to do with language. But no coherent idea on how or why our language does things differently than the communication of other species. Ultimately, it's a very evolutionistic view on the basis of culture that, while certainly not un-scientific, lacks the depth and nuance (or even the possibility of it) the genesis of culture probably was. A Neanderthal wouldn't be capable of certain complex cognitive functioning and a Sapiens would have, and at the same level - more or less - as contemporary humans, but he offers no real evidence of it. And ultimately, that is what evolutionary stories will always be: plausible yet uncertain what-if stories.
