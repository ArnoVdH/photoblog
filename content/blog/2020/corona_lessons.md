The corona crisis that is sweeping the planet has been going on for almost four months now. Belgium has been in 'lockdown' for around a month now. What are some (small) things I have learned and observed by now?

## People can work together as a society
Even if some don't follow the guidelines (I'm looking at you, elderly people) - even if it's a significant minority - the majority does its best to adhere to them. Even those that do only the barest of minimums or those that make mistakes are contributing to the collective effort. Thus the idea that society doesn't exist, is just a fairytale and that the only real thing is the set of individuals, has been proven false (yet again). Humanity *can* come together and *can* achieve things as a collective.

## Advertisement is visual pollution
All the public advertisement panels in my city have been replaced by '#staysafe' posters. It's still a form of advertisement (for the advert company itself) but born out of necessity and feel-good corporate optimism it forms a stark contrast to the usual panels of models trying to sell you cars, perfume or the newest kitchen appliances at discount rates. They are pleasingly uniform instead of a patchwork bombardement of attention-grabbing images. Just as the (implied) message itself: "we're all in this together, we have one goal, we can do this."

## Essential workers are under-payed and underfunded
With lots of workplaces closing and people (temporarily) out of a job, it has become quite clear, not only what jobs are the most essential for our day-to-day lives, but also that these are chronically under appreciated. And it's not just the health care sector that is groaning under the strain - not enough material, beds or staff - but others as well. Most of these are low wage jobs, with difficult hours, low social standing or a lot of job insecurity: the logistics sector, the cashiers and shelf-stockers from the supermarkets, trashmen, package and meal deliverers, public transport personnel and so much more. It took a lot of time for many of them to get the protection they needed to do their job safely, some of the regulations are being flouted by employers, they have to keep working under more stress and more difficult work conditions with little or no extra payment. More risk, no reward.

## "Now is not the time" will be the same argument they'll use after the crisis


## Work can be organized differently
This is most obvious for white-collar workers: turns out that working from home isn't all that difficult. The infrastructure existed already, it was just being denied to all lower-tier workers. This has a huge impact: less traffic jams, shorter commute times, less frustration, beter work-life balance.



## There is money, there is an alternative

## A strong social security system is our saving grace

## The United States is fucked (up)

## What should we remember from all of this?
