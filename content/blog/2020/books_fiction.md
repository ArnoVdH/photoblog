2020 was a good year, at least in terms of books read. And I don't think that the global pandemic had that much to do with it. I've read over XX books, which is probably a record (it is at least since 2016 when I started to keep a list of the books I read). But I haven't written many reviews. In this blogpost I'll revisit the fiction works I've read, chronologically, and write a line or two about it.
