It's the newest fantasy television series to hit the mainstream, this time produced by Netflix. It doesn't have the pretense or ambition to be a Game of Thrones style epic and holds up well all on its own.

The Witcher series gained renown through the games. The original The Witcher game came out back in 2007 and was... decent. It had an interesting story but also suffered from blatant juvenile sexism. The Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings (2011) did a lot better and was a graphical marvel, which paved the way for The Witcher  3: The Wild Hunt, a instant classic. But these games continued the stories from the books by the Polish author [Andrzej Sapkowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Sapkowski), which he began to write during the late eighties. So while the games were engaging on their own, there were a lot of references to earlier events. Until a few years ago, not all the books had been professionally translated yet and one had to rely on shoddy fan translations. This is what makes the new series so interesting to me personally, both as background to the games, as well as a recap of the crappy fan translations where a lot of things were literally lost in translation.

Hammy. True to the original stories (and thus a prequel to the games).
Decent production values.
Lots of fun.

Problematic aspects? Diversity, feminism? Ableism is a thing though.
