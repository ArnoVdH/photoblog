*Belgian Republicans: Radicals between two revolutions (1830-1850)* (Dutch: Belgische republikeinen: radicalen tussen twee revoluties) by Els Witte, historian and former rector of the Free University of Brussels (VUB).

It hasn't been translated yet, but since I'm using this post to synthesize some of my own idea(l)s on republicanism, I'll write in English.

### Chapter 1
Who's in the movement? Refugees from repressive regimes, (former) revolutionaries, students, journalists,... Loosely organized in societies, secret or otherwise, as collectives of journalists and newspapers, opposition groups... 

Their ideology is radical, a mix of jacobinism, radical democracy, proto-socialism and freethinking.

This resonates with me and my past as a member of a freethinking student society at university ('t Zal Wel Gaan) with a history of (admititely intellectual) radicalism and a history stretching back to the aftermath of the springtime of peoples in 1848 (the society was established in 1852, making it the oldest still existing student society in the country). I also heard Els Witte speak about her earlier book on Orangism in Belgium a few years ago.
