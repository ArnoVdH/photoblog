There's one game I find myself getting back to every few years, over and over again, and that's The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. It's also a popular topic of discussion, inspiration and reminiscence among friends of mine - a shared experience to touch upon every now and then, each having their own favorite parts of it. It definitly has achieve a sort of cult-status, but what exactly makes it such an enduring classic? And is it really better than its sequels? This is what I'd like to explore in this blogpost.

### Cliffracers eradicated in my most recent playthrough: 155

## A Word on Problems
I'd like to start by recognizing that the game has problems. Although I'm a huge fanboy, I try to be critical of things. Nothing is more annoying than someone not being able to contextualize their object of adoration.

First of all there is the obvious problem of age. The game came out in 2002 so it's obviously limited by the technology of its time. The modding community has done wonders with it though and solved quite a few of its limitations in graphics and a lot of the latent bugs have been fixed by the community. 

The biggest problem, to new players or maybe even in general, is probably the combat system. It's actually quite a standard implementation of dice-based mechanics from tabletop rpg's, but it doesn't work well with the first person combat that the game presents you with. It exists in between both those worlds and is therefore a bit uncanny. This is rectified in later iterations of The Elder Scrolls games.

Some people don't like the dialogue system in the game, but I beg to differ. The text-and-hyperlink-based system lowers the entry-level for mods (no need for professional voice-actors or expensive audio equipment) without breaking immersion. The hyperlink system offers a way to delve into the lore as deep as you want to. This system does break down a bit when using the journal, where everything gets muddled because of this. Even the addition of an quest-index did only a little to alleviate this.

A last limitation is that of the technology. Released in 2002, the game engine is dated and has its limitations. Graphically the game's textures are smudgy and effects are lacking, the island shrouded in a weird fog that limits your view distance (which one friend of mine thinks adds to the mystery of the island, so to view this as a deficiency is rather subjective). Quite a lot of these shortcomings can ben rectified by mods. There are loads of them, and also third-party programs and add-ons for managing and expanding the games possibilities. Community code patches fix lots of problems, tweak a lot of issues for a more enjoyable experience and add new possibilities for other mods. And then there are the huge Morrowind Graphics Extender XE (that adds loads of graphic options, such as rendering distant lands and adding shaders), Tamriel Rebuilt (reconstructiong all of the Morrowind province) and OpenMW (building a whole new engine for the game). These are not only what makes the game great, but are also proof of the quality of the original itself. 

## The World of Vvardenfell
More than the other The Elder Scrolls gmes, the island of Vvardenfell feels really alien. It's filled with wonderfully unique fauna, such as nixhounds, guars (both wild and tamed pack-animals) and the scourge of the cliffracers, or the floating jellyfish like netches, the mudcrabs and the staple of the local economy: the kwama that breed in underground lairs that function as 'egg-mines'. The only generic animals native to the land are rats. And I haven't mentioned the myriad of other creatures that can be encountered in dungeons, temples, ruins or caves everywhere, that dot the landscape.

The flora too is unique. Most recognizable are the giant mushrooms that grow in multiple regions instead of trees. The House Telvanni wizards even made their dwellings in magically grown ones, giving their cities an organic and confusing feel to them. But lots of other plants are important, culturally as foodstaples or as alchemical ingredients. Giant sponges, bulbous roots, saltrice, ash yams, all kinds of flowers and weeds, are all original and have their own set of properties.

The landscaping too is something that deserves admiration: the island, dominated by its large volcano, isn't actually all that big (around half of Oblivion and Skyrim), but it does feel huge by smart placement of obstacles, landmarks and travel options. There is no fast-travel options, except for payed-for transportation by boat and siltstrider (oh, did I mention giant fleas that are used as caravan transports?) or teleportation to fixed points such as temples and mages guilds, and only around half the island is quickly accessible through any of these means. The Ashlands, one of the hundred little islets of Azura's Coast, the inner Grazelands or the desolate Molag Amur volcanic pits require the player to at least travel there on foot from a distant outpost. While this was primarily a smart way to make the most of the limited viewing distance to create a sense of distance and space, it's a testament of its ingenuity that it holds up very well with the MGE XE distant lands generated. The added visual fidelity never did away with the necessity of following vague directions and roadsigns to get to where you want to be. It makes it a litter easier maybe, by being able to orient yourself with some distant daedric ruins for instance, but it never spoils the search.

Besides that, it also feels like a believable place: the differences in between regions are carefully balanced with its similarities. Red Mountain provides a grateful justification for this: whole parts of the land are influenced by it: foyadas ('fire rivers') cutting through the landscape, lands filled with volcanic activity and covered in ash. These contrast nicely with the more lush and habitable regions such as the swamplike Bitter Coast, the verdant Ascadian Isles or the rocky Zafirbel Bay, dotted with many islands, both inhabited as barren, and rocks jutting out of the sea.

This 2020 playthrough was also one of the first times really exploring the larger landmass created by the Tamriel Rebuilt project.

## Design
The alien-ness extends beyond just the geography, fauna and flora. Arguably more important is the strange culture you end up in as an outsider.
Architecture
Mud architecture, Telvanni wizard towers, Vivec city, ancestral tombs & old strongholds.

It's telling that the least original elements are those that are actually from outside of Morrowind and Dunmer culture proper: Empire architecture is based on the Roman styles, Nord elements are medieval and viking influenced...

design of enemies: daedric creatures, dwemer constructs,... weapons and armour: kinda clunky and a bit too edgy. Unfortunately there's no incentive to keep using lower-end armour although it's design is actually more integrated into the culture, such as chittin or bonemold, functioning also as survival outfits for the often hostile environments with it's diseases and ashstorms.

## Lore and prophecy
You're only  the hero because you make it so.

## Tribunal & Bloodmoon
Tribunal is a bit of a mixed bag. The City of Mournhold feels empty. Even though the architecture is interesting, the vast spaces are sparsely populated with almost nothing to do. The dungeons are interesting though, the idea of 'lost underground city', haunted catacombs and antediluvian Dwemer ruins are engaging and impressive.

Although I've played Morrowind quite a lot, completing the main quest, explorer the world time and again, I never ventured into the Bloodmoon expansion before, except for a short trip to Fort Frostmoth and a quick return trip. So this playthrough was the first time exploring the snowy forests and defiling its ancient barrows. While the expansion is well rounded in itself, the isle of Solstheim just isn't that interesting as the rest of Morrowind. It's in effect a premonition of the later games that step back from weird, original world-building and a move towards more traditional fantasy settings, in this case the viking-like Nords.

## Playing in 2020
More than 17 years after its release, the game still inspires people. A huge community of fans keeps making art and mods for the game. The [Tamriel Rebuilt](https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/) project has been working the extended Morrowind province (in contrast to just the island of Vvardenfell in the original game) for two decades. Seperate mods are being released daily and there is a team working on a full remake of the game in the newer Skyrim engine, called [Skywind](https://tesrskywind.com/). Another big project is [OpenMW](https://openmw.org/en/), a new engine for the game that runs on modern hardware and adds native support of new technologies. There's even a musician called Young Scrolls making music inspired by Morrowind: definitely check out [Balmora Vice](https://youtu.be/pRErZ4PTY70) or [Dagothwave](https://youtu.be/iR-K2rUP86M)!

I reinstalled the game and did another playthrough during the covid-19 crisis and wrote this piece. I used the [Morrowind Graphics Guide](https://wiki.nexusmods.com/index.php/Morrowind_graphics_guide) and [Thasthus' guide](https://github.com/Tyler799/Morrowind-2019/blob/master/Morrowind_2019.md) as a basis and learned to work with [Wrye Mash](https://danaeplays.thenet.sk/wrye-mash/) to install and manage the huge amount of mods.

One thing I wonder is how will all this change by 2030? Or 2040? Will this game reach a certain status enjoyed by some movies or other artwork? Will it still be playable, the community alive? Will we recognize the modders work as being a vital part and even some sort of digital archeology for keeping the old game alive, both by updating it for contemporary use or by remaking it? But also: will I still play it? And will I still find something new to appreciate that I didn't before?
