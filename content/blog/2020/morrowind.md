Intro

### Cliffracers eradicated in my most recent playthrough: 155

<!--more-->

## A Word on Problems
Game has problems of course.
Combat.
Limitations of the engine.

## The World of Vvardenfell
Feels larger than it is.
Feels alien.
You get around by following descriptions of the path, not always a marker on a map.
Looks good even with distant land generated in MGEXE.
Extended with Tamriel Rebuilt over the years.

MUSHROOMS

## Design
Architecture
Mud architecture, Telvanni wizard towers, Vivec city, ancestral tombs & old strongholds.

It's telling that the least original elements are those that are actually from outside of Morrowind and Dunmer culture proper: Empire architecture is based on the Roman styles, Nord elements are medieval and viking influenced...

## Lore and prophecy
You're only  the hero because you make it so.

## Playing in 2020
More than 17 years after its release, the game still inspires people. A huge community of fans keeps making art and mods for the game. The [Tamriel Rebuilt](https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/) project has been working the extended Morrowind province (in contrast to just the island of Vvardenfell in the original game) for two decades. Seperate mods are being released daily and there is a team working on a full remake of the game in the newer Skyrim engine, called [Skywind](https://tesrskywind.com/). There's even a musician called Young Scrolls making music inspired by Morrowind: definitely check out [Balmora Vice](https://youtu.be/pRErZ4PTY70) or [Dagothwave]https://youtu.be/iR-K2rUP86M)!

I reinstalled the game and did another playthrough during the covid-19 crisis and wrote this piece. I used the [Morrowind Graphics Guide](https://wiki.nexusmods.com/index.php/Morrowind_graphics_guide) and [Thasthus' guide](https://github.com/Tyler799/Morrowind-2019/blob/master/Morrowind_2019.md) as a basis and learned to work with [Wrye Mash](https://danaeplays.thenet.sk/wrye-mash/) to install and manage the huge amount of mods.

BAD VERION

---

I don't know exactly when I played The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind for the first time, but I've kept coming back to it for more than a decade. It has inspired lots of dreaming, writing and discussion among friends and even a pen & paper tabletop roleplay campaign. It has been a game I came back to every few years. But what is it that makes Morrowind such an enduring cult classic? And is it really better than its sequels?

## A word on problems

Before I start exalting the genius of Morrowind, I will admit there are, of course, problems with the game. Games, as media-type, generally have two forms of problems: technological problems and problems having to do with the actual content. The overlap between the two are the design problems, where there is a feedback loop between both sides.

The technological problems have to do with limitations on performance and other bottlenecks. Since Morrowind came out in 2002, we can expect the game engine to be limited in lots of aspects. This hasn't stopped modders to get the most out of the engine and even built the Morrowind Graphics Extender (MGE XE) to overcome some of these limitations. It's a testament to its enduring allure that people went through all the trouble to built these mods, plugins, addons and extenders on their own time, and this makes many, if not most, of the technological limitations due to its age moot.

The biggest problems Morrowind has are actually those of design: things that have been coded into the game and are difficult to fix even with mods. The main problem in this regard has always been the combat system. It's the legacy of the pen & paper inspired roleplaying games with their abstract dice rolls which gives the first person combat a uncanny feeling, lacking the physicality that later games such as Oblivion and Skyrim did have. 

## The Elder Design

The originality of design, something that has been missing in the sequels.
Visual and art design, but also level design.

## The Isle of Vvardenfell

The land of the game itself is wonderfully crafted and holds up very well; even with MGE XE it doesn't *feel* small, even though the distances involved are quite small. Turning distant lands on makes navigating by sight easier - looking for some Daedric ruins to orient yourself for instance - and makes you feel less like walking in a misty tube with the sky clear above you. But it does this while not making everything visible and obvious, and here we have to thank the game designers and not the MGE XE modders. They did mostly by cleverly using the terrain. Most paths wind around difficult to climb mountains and in the south-western corner of the island they are very clear and inviting to follow. Mountain ranges, foyada's ('fire-rivers', gullies through which lava flows during an eruption), misty and rainy weather, ash storms and Red Mountain itself provide natural limitation on the landscape. Besides these there's also the vegetation (huge trees and mushrooms) and architecture, such as the huge cantons of Vivec, towering above everything.

Vvardenfell is composed of many different regions, each unique but with some similarities to make it a recognizable whole. There are the Sheogorad and Azura's Coast regions, both dotted with thousands of needle like rocks. The West Gash and Grazelands are similar biomes, but the former is crossed with gullies and canyons and the latter is a wide open expanse. The same goes for the different Ashland regions: Ald'ruhn, being one of the only inhabited places there, is a harsh place to live; Molag Amur where lava lakes make it difficult to navigate; the northren Ashlands, uninhabited save for the camp of the Urshilaku tribe; and finally Red Mountain itself, surrounded by the Ghostfence to keep the worst horrors contained. Navigating the Ashlands is a difficult task, especially with the sudden ash-storms, sent by Dagoth-Ur, that orientation difficult and spread blight-disease.

Each region also has it's own style of towns and cities, and the architecture says a lot about who lives there. Each of the three Great Houses has their own distinct style. The Telvanni have their curling wizard's towers that may be somewhat confusing to walk around in, the Hlaalu plantations are stylish and blocky and Redoran architecture is very organic and reminiscent of crustaceans (actually, their council is located in a huge empty crab shell). There's also the Imperial style, clashing with the native environment, which conveys just how much of a foreign thing the Imperial administration is (even though it's the most clich√© Western-medieval-fantasy-style buildings).

Apart from the regions, the island is strewn with tombs, caves and other hide-outs. Ruins aplenty too: ancient fortresses - long forgotten; daedric ruins swarming with demonic creatures and hostile worshippers; Dwemer strongholds, eerily empty except for their still animated mechanical guardians. Another commonon sight are mines, probably the most important industry of Morrowind: ebony and glass mines, strictly guarded by the Imperial administration, but also the kwama egg-mines that provide one of the food staples of the land.

## Lore Galore

The story and the incredibly deep lore.

The role and function of prophecy. You start with a bunch of research errands given to you by Caius Cosades into the specifics of the Nerevarine prophecies and it becomes immediately clear that things aren't as clear cut as just 'there's this prophecy, you are the chosen one, go do the task.'

It feels real because it's not tailored to the player (to make him feel powerful etc) but feels like a complex society, with different interest groups, each with their own values, ideas and goals. Instead of just 'factions' for you to join and run through all the quests they offer you.
