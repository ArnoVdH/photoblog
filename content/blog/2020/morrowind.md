I don't know exactly when I played The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind for the first time, but I've kept coming back to it for more than a decade. It has inspired lots of dreaming, writing and discussion among friends and even a pen & paper tabletop roleplay campaign.

## A word on problems

Before I start exalting the genius of Morrowind, I will admit there are, of course, problems with the game. Games, as media-type, generally have two forms of problems: technological problems and problems having to do with the actual content. The overlap between the two are the design problems, where there is a feedback loop between both sides.

The technological problems have to do with limitations on performance and other bottlenecks. Since Morrowind came out in 2002, we can expect the game engine to be limited in lots of aspects. This hasn't stopped modders to get the most out of the engine and even built the Morrowind Graphics Extender (MGE XE) to overcome some of these limitations. It's a testament to its enduring allure that people went through all the trouble to built these mods, plugins, addons and extenders on their own time, and this makes many, if not most, of the technological limitations due to its age moot.

The biggest problems Morrowind has are actually those of design: things that have been coded into the game and are difficult to fix even with mods. The main problem in this regard has always been the combat system. It's the legacy of the pen & paper inspired roleplaying games with their abstract dice rolls which gives the first person combat a uncanny feeling, lacking the physicality that later games such as Oblivion and Skyrim did have. 

## The Elder Design

The originality of design, something that has been missing in the sequels.
Visual and art design, but also level design.

## The Isle of Vvardenfell

The world feels way bigger than it actually is, even when playing with the Morrowind Graphics Extender (MGE XE)

## Lore Galore

The story and the incredibly deep lore.
The role and function of prophecy.

It feels real because it's not tailored to the player (to make him feel powerful etc) but feels like a complex society, with different interest groups, each with their own values, ideas and goals. Instead of just 'factions' for you to join and run through all the quests they offer you.

## Playing Morrowind in 2020

More than 17 years after its release, the game still inspires people. A huge community of fans keeps making art and mods for the game. The Tamriel Rebuilt project has been working the extended Morrowind province (in contrast to just the island of Vvardenfell in the original game) for more than a decade. Seperate mods are being released daily and there is a team working on a full remake of the game in the newer Skyrim engine.
