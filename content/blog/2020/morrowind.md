I don't know exactly when I played The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind for the first time, but I've kept coming back to it for more than a decade.

<!--more-->

Of course there are problems with the game.

Technology is dated but still charming.

The originality of design, something that has been missing in the sequels.
Visual and art design, but also level design.

The world feels way bigger than it actually is, even when playing with the Morrowind Graphics Extender (MGE XE)

The story and the incredibly deep lore. 
The role and function of prophecy.

It feels real because it's not tailored to the player (to make him feel powerful etc) but feels like a complex society, with different interest groups, each with their own values, ideas and goals. Instead of just 'factions' for you to join and run through all the quests they offer you.

More than 17 years after its release, the game still inspires people. A huge community of fans keeps making art and mods for the game. The Tamriel Rebuilt project has been working the extended Morrowind province (in contrast to just the island of Vvardenfell in the original game) for more than a decade. Seperate mods are being released daily and there is a team working on a full remake of the game in the newer Skyrim engine.
