Over the past few years I've become increasingly uneasy with Facebook and social media in general. I've had an account for over a decade now (since 2008) and it has become such a integrated presence in my life that it's difficult for me to imagine it otherwise. But year after year, new revelations become public, new scandals get out, another terrible event get exacerbated, more misinformation spreads,... My insight into the technological, psychological and polticial functioning of social media on us as individuals and society has grown. And the negative conclusion is inescapable: it's not good.

I *know* that I should quit - I've known that for some years now. I've made quite some changes to my online behaviour already. I cut out a whole bunch of Google owned apps, got rid of WhatsApp and switched to Signal, removed the Facebook app and Facebook Messenger from my phone. But in the end, I still have and use Facebook daily. There's friends I keep in contact with, events to keep track of, updates about things I like (literally, in the case of Facebook). The idea to leave it all behind gives me some sort of anxiety: *I'll lose so much.* 

Therefore I have resolved to pledge to quit Facebook by the end of this *annus horribilis*.

## Reasons
There are a plethora of good reasons to have issues and doubts around the use of Facebook and I think that taken together points towards the obvious conclusion: don't be on Facebook. The problem is that once you're in, it's difficult to get out of. The easiest would be to not have joined in the first place. There are a few people I know that had the foresight (even if their reasons were not necessarily those that I have today) to never join; and I guess that some sort of "hats off" would be approriate to them. "Better never to have been... on Facebook." But since I'm past that point, the threshold to overcome is quite a bit higher. 

### Ownership of data: you are the product
While Facebook is ostensibly a social media service, that's actually not completely true. It's an advertisement agency (the largest in the world) that uses it's social media services to gather it's input data and as digital billboard to project to it's billions of 'users'.

### Privacy: you are not the client
The data you generate is being used against you in subtle yet scary ways.

### Sadness by design: mental health
The culture of influencers projects an unattainable image, and no matter how aware we are of this, it projects an image that we have to battle against daily. Justifying why we ourselves don't live at least a fraction of those imaginary lives that are shown to be so desirable.

### The new puritanism: big tech loves conservatism
The #FreeTheNipple campaign has been around for years.
Tumblr taking a neo-puritan turn was a shocker to the community.
Disproportionate crackdown on non-heteronormative imagery (in a society where images are central to our discourse) and the enforcement of the dominant, *American* mores on everything.

It's a fine line to a social network to straddle, for sure, but there are better ways to deal with it than crack down on material just because it's outside the norm.

### The algorithm: echo-chambers and manipulation
A simple psychological mechanic helps explain quite a bit: the goal is to maximize date input from users; that's why there is incentive to choose ways that maximizes user interaction. This applies both for Facebook itself, as for the corporations, people and organizations on it, thus creating a feedback loop. This not only creates political echo-chambers, but also breeds a certain extremism (which I differentiate from radicalism, which is principled).

While some tech-companies have said they would intervene, the major issue still is that the fundamental reality of social media encourages these trends and this will only be reversed by forcefull intervention in the sector.

### Downfall of democracy


## Cons
### What will I lose?

### Necessary?

### Won't we miss it?

### Business presence
If you have a business of any kind these days, it's unfortunately almost always in your (financial) advantage to have a presence on social media.

## Alternatives?
### Federated social media

### Self-hosting your data

## The Plan
Part of the plan will be the utilization of older and proven methods of communication.

### Update and maintain a comprehensive contact list


### Things to do on Facebook & Instagram
* Decide on tattoo artist(s)

### Reach out
* make a list of people to contact directly

### Supply easy-to-use alternatives

### Decide on a set of options to have online presence

### Download data

### Disable Facebook feed
As a first step

### Remove Instagram

### Remove Facebook

### Peace of mind
