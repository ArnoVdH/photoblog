Over the past few years I've become increasingly uneasy with Facebook and social media in general. I've had an account for over a decade now (since 2008) and it has become such a integrated presence in my life that it's difficult for me to imagine it otherwise. But year after year, new revelations become public, new scandals get out, another terrible event get exacerbated, more misinformation spreads,... My insight into the technological, psychological and polticial functioning of social media on us as individuals and society has grown. And the negative conclusion is inescapable: it's not good.

I *know* that I should quit - I've known that for some years now. I've made quite some changes to my online behaviour already. I cut out a whole bunch of Google owned apps, got rid of WhatsApp and switched to Signal, removed the Facebook app and Facebook Messenger from my phone. But in the end, I still have and use Facebook daily. There's friends I keep in contact with, events to keep track of, updates about things I like (literally, in the case of Facebook). The idea to leave it all behind gives me some sort of anxiety: *I'll lose so much.* 

**Therefore I have resolved to pledge to quit Facebook by the end of this *annus horribilis*.**

## Reasons
There are a plethora of good reasons to have issues and doubts around the use of Facebook and I think that taken together points towards the obvious conclusion: don't be on Facebook. The problem is that once you're in, it's difficult to get out of. The easiest would be to not have joined in the first place. There are a few people I know that had the foresight (even if their reasons were not necessarily those that I have today) to never join; and I guess that some sort of "hats off" would be approriate to them. "Better never to have been... on Facebook." But since I'm past that point, the threshold to overcome is quite a bit higher. 

### Ownership of data: you are the product
While Facebook is ostensibly a social media service, that's actually not completely true. It's an advertisement agency first (and one of the largest in the world at that) that uses it's social media services to gather it's input data and as digital billboard to project to its billions of 'users'. The service it renders to us is not profitable in itself but is still provided for free, thus creating a need to monitize the service in another way. Selling it's users time spent on the platform is how this works: advertisers pay facebook for an amount of views that can be very specifically targeted and tailored for its intended audience. *They* pay Facebook and *they* are the customers, not the users. Or as the adage goes: "If you're not paying for it, you're the product."

We - willingly - input huge amounts of date into our profiles, so as to better use the platforms. But legally, the data is stored on the platforms servers over which they retain ownership; even if they don't require you to sign over your copyright to them, which they often do. But who reads those user agreements anyway? But this is exactly how they can keep operating in legality and why (their) ownership of (your) data is so important. We need solutions for these (and there are) but that will require to start accepting the cost of data ownership.[^1]

### Privacy: you are not the client
The data you generate is being used against you. Like I said before, they are used to tailor ads specifically for us and deliver the tools for very precise targetting. Based, not only, on what we input ourselves (mainly text and images), but also how we interect with the platform, what we do outside of the platform (by using those tracking cookies every website keeps bugging us about) and what we do in the outside world (gps-tracking). This is very invasive to say the least and many of us are at least vaguely aware of it but seem te be able to shrug it off as not important to us personally (as do I) - but it most definitely is. 

We're in some sort of collective delusion that our data is relatively safe, that the ads are benign, that Facebook and Zuckerberg genuinly regret the bad things that have happened. My guess is that this is because of how we use the platform: as something intimate, between friends, family and acquaintences. We rarely see the other side of Facebook, only our connections on our timeline. This *feels* personal and somewhat limited, like some sort of online village mentality where you cross paths with people you (at least) recognize and ads that are relevant to your own life - in the past your local bakery sponsored the football team, displaying their name on t-shirts, now you see ads for them on your timeline, what's the difference?

But we have to face facts: the financial logic dictates that these companies turn an (ever-increasing) profit, so they have every incentive to use and abuse the data we supply them with to maximize the efficiency of their algorithms, so as to make their service all the more valuable to their real customers. Privacy concerns stand in the way of this goal and are thus only in name only (and even then) important to them.

### Sadness by design: mental health
We've known this longer than social media have been around: displaying unrealistic and often unattainable imagery has a severy impact on people's self-perception and sense of self-worth. For decades there has been criticism leveled against the fashion industry, with still only token rectification on these points.

But what happens when not some designers, journalists and editors, limited to catwalks and magazines, have a say in this: but hugely powerful algorithms that force upon us a logic that demands the impossible from ordinary users? Enter the influencer-culture: in order to gain views and clicks (and sponserships that depend on these numbers), they present a certain (mostly positive) image of their lives. In essence it's a form of exhibitionism: they open their meticulously curated lives up to us, the viewers. We're all very aware of this, but in this constant mental battle over our attention, we're the ones that lose out.

And it's not just the influencers, whose livelihoods are derived from this, but also the 'common user'. We also succumb to the algorithm by way of 'likes': the system demands for us to show positive things, to show us how our lives are good (and better than someone else's maybe). A constant pressure to prove to our network and the world at large that our embellished (or even imaginary) lives are equally as desirable, if not more so, than those of our supposed peers. And if not, if we think we've seen through the charade, we'll let the voyeurs in and feast upon our misery. We've all entered the competition and it's wearing people out. And weary people become less critical... It's a win-win, but not for us.

### The new puritanism: big tech loves conservatism
At the end of 2018, Tumblr (where I had two blogs that I actively used) decided to ban pornography. This was a huge shock for the community: until then it had been one of the last big places that allowed creative content of this kind and was therefore a safe haven, not just for artists, photographers and bloggers, but also for minority groups (especially LGBTQ+) and sexworkers. It made it a vibrant community with lots of content and an excellent platform for people wanting to share their niche-art. But the new ban put a stop on all that, and even though my own blogs didn't violate any of the new standards[^2], I decided to quit the platform in disagreement.

This is but one minor exemple, and Tumblr was never that omni-present as some other companies are. But it shows how much say they have in decided *for us* what is acceptable and what is not. And most, if not all, of these tech giants are, weirdly, very puritanical and sexist. Nudity is only allowed if it's deemed tasteful (not deviating from the patriarchical beauty standards) or if the nipples "are not female-presenting" (in the case of Tumblr). There has been a disproportionate crackdown on non-heteronormative imagery (in a society where images are central to our discourse) and the enforcement of the dominant, *American* mores on everything. Because of this, there is less artistic freedom, less space for minorities and less room for discussion on these topics.

It's a fine line to a social network to straddle, for sure: how to keep these spaces family-friendly? But there are better ways to deal with it than crack down on material just because it's outside the norm. Active, human moderation and federation (see below) are possible answers to this pheonomenon.

### The algorithm: echo-chambers and manipulation
A simple psychological mechanic helps explain quite a bit: as we've seen, the goal is to maximize data input from users; that's why there is incentive to choose ways that maximizes user interaction. This applies both for Facebook itself, as for the corporations, people and organizations on it, thus creating a feedback loop. And as it turns out, posts that generate idignation, anger and division generate huge amounts of interaction. This not only creates political echo-chambers, but also breeds a certain extremism.[^3]

While some tech-companies have said they would intervene, the major issue still is that the fundamental reality of social media encourages these trends and this will only be reversed by forcefull, radical intervention in the sector. Self-regulation will never remedy the underlying, systemic problems.

### Downfall of democracy
Ever since the rise of social media and manipulative tech giants, we've seen the steady erosion of our (admitattly flawed) democracies. Trust in the media as trustworthy declined and so-called 'fake news' and conspiracy theories are on the rise. The value of truth and the meaning of words has become fuzzy. And now, not for the first time, the right has expertly used this, in tandem with the decline in the economic system under 'late-stage' capitalism, to further their cause. The targeted ads make it possible to influence the fractured (working) classes, while the left specifically needs these to be united to excercise their power. I fear that, at the minimum, we'll see continued hollowing-out of our democracies and the rule of law. This means regression on all fronts, increasing repression and an overall grim future.

Where, at some times during the 20th century, it could be argued that capitalism and democracy went hand in hand, these have since parted ways. It's not, and never has been, in capitalism's intrinsic interests to support democratic principles. It is, in my opinion, folly to hope for a solution within a capitalist framework to fix these issues. Any solution will have to be contrary to this profit-oriented logic and will need to include a return to democratic participation in how to shape the fundamentals of our society, including the digital.

## Cons
### What will I lose?
Let's face it: I *will* lose something substantial here. A service and tool[^4] that I've used to maintain contact and regulate my own (social) life this last decade. But let's go into a little bit more detail and make a list; lists are fun, aren't they?

* Faraway friend will become more difficult to follow
* I will be less likely to have (semi-)spontaneous online conversations
* I'll have to actively look for events
* I'll miss out on a lot of awesome artists and their work
* An easy way to organize and coordinate through shared group pages
* Important (and semi-important) life-events of people will elude me

After writing this remarkebly short list, 

### Necessary?

### Won't we miss it?

### No blame on users
What I emphatically don't want to do is blame people that do use social media. I think leaving the platforms takes quite a bit of effort (hell, I haven't even quit yet) and entails a certain amount of privilege to do. And even then, some people have little choice to stick to the platforms because of a multitude of reasons.

If you have a business of any kind these days, it's unfortunately always in your (financial) advantage to have a presence on social media. And there are many others whose livelihoods depend in some way or another on those platforms. It can't be expected that these people join a movement away from the big corporations until the real changes have already happened.

## The Plan
Since leaving Facebook is quite the undertaking, it requires a plan. There are some suggestions to be found online, such as articles in [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/technology/personaltech/how-to-delete-facebook-instagram-account.html) and [Lifewire](https://www.lifewire.com/close-facebook-and-shut-down-your-account-2654265); even the occasional article about [failing to quit](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/28/17293056/facebook-deletefacebook-social-network-monopoly). There are also various online communities such as [r/corpfree](https://www.reddit.com/r/CorpFree/) where users gather to give tips and alternatives, or maybe deride you for still using social media altogether. (I am aware of the irony of using Reddit in this instance)

Part of the plan will be the utilization of older and proven methods of communication. This wil require more work and maybe some side costs, but remember: you'll pay for things one way or another.

### Update and maintain a comprehensive contact list
Remember a time, back in the nineties, when most families had a little booklet with contacts in them, lying besides the telephone in the hallway or living room. That idea still has its uses and has its digital implementation in the form of CardDAV (a webDAV standard): a digital contact list that bundles all kinds of useful information on people. The only thing is: you have to build the list yourself, instead of relying on social media to provide those things for you. But once collected (and maybe synched with other apps) you have a reliable list that keeps you updated on people's birthdays just as efficient as Facebook does. Luckily, my e-mail account also included a contact-list service (and calendar too) for me to use.

### Things to do on Facebook & Instagram
* Decide on tattoo artist(s)

### Reach out
I'll reach out, through status updates on Facebook and stories on Instagram. I'm aware that some people will find this obnoxious behaviour, but social media is full of those already, so that's not a big deal. I'll be pro-active and talk to some people directly and others can decide for themselves if they find it worthwile to have my contact info (or think that I should have theirs).

### Supply easy-to-use alternatives


### Decide on a set of options to have online presence

### Download data


### Disable Facebook feed
As a first step towards removing Facebook, I'll follow the example of a friend of mine who shut down his feed and only uses it to interact with certain groups he's part of and to chat.

### Remove Instagram
Instagram is part of the Facebook ecosystem. Even though there's arguably a somewhat more accepting and positive atmosphere in my own personal experience, there's still a lot wrong with it: extensive censorship, puritanism, advertisement, lack of privacy. The only feature I'll really miss are the 'stories'. 

### Remove Facebook
Deleting Facebook takes a whopping 30 days, in which you can always log back in to restore the account. This is to make sure you get ample time to develop some remorse or be tempted back in. 

### Peace of mind
The endgoal here.

[^1]: I prefer to think about the cost the users (as individuals or, preferably, as a community) have to bear instead of the price the tech giants should have to pay (by way of a data-tax for exemple), because it's more empowering to the users.

[^2]: Some of my pictures were falsely flagged as being inappropriate, and although I could and did appeal, those were eventually overturned for no good reason, making it impossible to reinstate some of my personal photography.

[^3]: I differentiate extremism, which is irrational and accelerationist, from radicalism, which is principled and restrained.

[^4]: In the recent Netflix documentary 'The Social Dilemma' Tristan Harris posits that tools are 'patient' objects, waiting for you to use them, while social media *demands* your attention and input. "[W]e've moved away from having a tools-based technology environment to an addiction- and manipulation-based technology environment."
