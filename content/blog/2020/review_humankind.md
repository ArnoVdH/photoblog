+++
Humankind is a best-seller in the Netherlands and Flanders, where it's called 'De meeste mensen deugen' (literally *most people are good*). It's quite voluminous and claims to justify a radically different image of humanity. It has been hailed as a masterpiece of optimism in the press and quite a few people in my *milieu* have praised it too. This made me somewhat sceptical about it, analogous to Sapiens by Harari (which I found to be horribly superficial and totally devoid of anything interesting). Unjustified, so it turned out. I was positively surprised by the book. It's a flame in these dark times that we, society can be bettered.

[Rutger Bregman](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutger_Bregman) is a Dutch historian and journalist. He writes for [De Correspondent](https://decorrespondent.nl/), a news site focussing on well researched long-read articles and not on daily news - without disregarding topical news items entirely. He's also a well known advocate of a universal basic income, which is how I got to know about him years ago when researching and writing on the same topic.

Other books like this.

Nuanced arguments. Mixes history, psychology and philosophy. Especially the big classical psychological cases that are still central in a lot of narratives such as the stanford prison experiment, the milgram experiment and the kitty genevese case.

Hopeful message.

Writing style. Didn't like it, would've liked it to be more rigurous but that would diminish its reach. I'd say it doesn't stand in the way of the value of this book.

Criticism: nothing about the problematic influence of organisations, states, economics, ideology, social media, etc... as dangerous for this optimistic view of humankind.
