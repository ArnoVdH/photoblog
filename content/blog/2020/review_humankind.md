+++
Humankind is a best-seller in the Netherlands and Flanders, where it's called 'De meeste mensen deugen' (literally *most people are good*). It's quite voluminous and claims to justify a radically different image of humanity. It has been hailed as a masterpiece of optimism in the press and quite a few people in my *milieu* have praised it too. This made me somewhat sceptical about it, analogous to Sapiens by Harari (which I found to be horribly superficial and totally devoid of anything interesting). Unjustified, so it turned out. I was positively surprised by the book. It's a flame in these dark times that we, society can be bettered.

[Rutger Bregman](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutger_Bregman) is a Dutch historian and journalist. He writes for [De Correspondent](https://decorrespondent.nl/), a news site focussing on well researched long-read articles and not on daily news - without disregarding topical news items entirely. He's also a well known advocate of a universal basic income, which is how I got to know about him years ago when researching and writing on the same topic.

This is a book that fits within the wider phenomenon of all encompassing *explanations* (for lack of a better word) of humanity, both in a historical as a existential sense. That is to say: they try to grapple with some of the large questions in life. Who and what are we, where do we come from as a being and society and what can it tells us about our future? Another well known book in this genre is Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari; which I also read this year, but found profoundly lacking. Humankind is Bregman's try at the big question of human nature.

What bothered me from the beginning on was his writing style. I would have liked for it to be more rigorous and dry. Some of the analogies and anecdotes are superficial and his characterization of his 'good man' as *homo puppy* comes across as childish. Bregman obviously tries to reach a broad as possible public and it probably works, but because of this is exists in between different registers.



Nuanced arguments. Mixes history, psychology and philosophy. Especially the big classical psychological cases that are still cill central in a lot of narratives such as the stanford prison experiment, the milgram experiment and the kitty genevese case.

Criticism: nothing about the problematic influence of organisations, states, economics, ideology, social media, etc... as dangerous for this optimistic view of humankind.

All in all, the book succeeds in relaying its hopeful message about humanity.
