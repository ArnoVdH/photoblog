Looking for alternatives for the big corporations.

My personal journey.

Not an easy one. And absolutely not complete. I am no high-tech wizzkid, no privacy saint, nor a recluse.

A quick word on self-hosting: in quite a few of the cases below, self-hosting would be a great option, especially if you're tech-savvy enough and have a higher risk profile. I'm neither, so I chose other options.

## E-mail
**Status: done ✔**

This was actually pretty easy to do. One of the reasons, I guess, is that, for one thing, e-mail has a long established history pre-dating the contemporary internet giants. There are quite a few privacy oriented possibilities available.

I opted to use [posteo](https://posteo.de/en), a German e-mail provider with quite a comprehensive privacy policy and transparent communication and a very fair pricing policy (1 euro per month). I think that paying for such a service is worth it; this way I don't get served advertisements and the provider will have less incentive to sell-out and compromise my data. Posteo uses green energy to run their services and offer multiple security measures such as encryption, 2FA (two-factor authentication) and anonymous payment options.

The biggest hurdle in switching e-mail addresses is changing all your accounts to use your new address. This takes some time but I would encourage you to make use of this moment to start using a **[password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager)** for added security and easy account management. I myself use [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/).

## Calendar
**Status: done ✔**

The actual calendar was easy: it came with a posteo account (together with an adress book). Easy enough to use on my desktop. The problem was setting it up to sync with an app on my smartphone, so I could use it as my planner. This required quite a bit of trial and error and fiddling. In the end I used aCalendar+ as the calendar app itself and DAVx<sup>5</sup>, a payed app, to make synching with CalDAV possible. I've been using it for more than a year now and I'm very happy with it. The only issue that I encountered were some birthdays that had their month and day switched, which led to some akward conversations, but all took it in good humour.

## Chat & messaging

Signal

## Search page

## Desktop operating system
**Status: to do ✘**

I'm hoping to make the definite switch to Linux at the end of this year. One of the big issues, as with anyone wanting to switch, is choosing which distro to use.

Independant/dependant?
Debian (stabiel)
    Ubuntu (huge, stabiel)
Arch (slim, clutter-free, well documented)
    Manjaro (toegankelijk, rolling release,...)
Void (nieuw? ontoegankelijk)
Fedora (reinstall nodig om de zoveel tijd, laat maar)
Gentoo (blijkbaar out of favor)
Solus (???) - https://getsol.us/home/


Questions:
-Rolling release?
-Desktop environment?
-Proprietary software allowed?
-Difficulty?
-Ecosystem?
-Package manager?
-Gaming feasible?

## Mobile operating System
There are a few possibilities:
* LineageOS
* /e/
* Replicant
* GrapheneOS
