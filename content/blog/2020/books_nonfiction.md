2020 was a good year, at least in terms of books read. And I don't think that the global pandemic had that much to do with it. I've read over XX books, which is probably a record (it is at least since 2016 when I started to keep a list of the books I read). But I haven't written many reviews. In this blogpost I'll go over the non-fiction works that I've read, chronologically, and write some of my thoughts about them.

### Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? - Caitlin Dought
Fun and gruesome. Ideal for children *or* as bathroom literature. 

### Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind - Yuval Noah Harari
Overblown. It's a crystalized liberal worldview, meant for self-assured, self-proclaimed progressives to read and agree with. There's a baffling lack of nuance or anything remotely thought-provoking. 

### In Praise of Shadows** - Junichirō Tanizaki
Amusing essays on the importance of light or, more importantly, the lack thereof. And about the superiority of Japanese, rustic outdoor toilets.

### War! What Is It Good For? - Ian Morris
Yet another all-encompassing history of humanity, but this time much more limited in scope, revoling around one hypothesis: war has, in the long term, made our societies more peaceful. In contrast with Harari, Morris' story is much more empirical (except for the boring evolutionary chapter) and thus convincing.

### The Bullet Journal Method - Ryder Carroll
Lots of interesting tips about how to organize your own notebook. I've found it really helps me be more productive, if I can just hang on. Oh, and my journal is always an ugly but functional ugly mess.

### The Communist Manifesto - Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels
A classic I've reread. Interesting but actually the least interesting marxist text I read this year.

### Taal voor de leuk - Paulien Cornelisse
Short and amusing reflections on the Dutch language. Nothing special.

### Seven Brief Lessons on Physics - Carlo Rovelli
Layman's introduction to physics. Does what it says on the cover.

### De meeste mensen deugen - Rutger Bregman
The surprise of the year. I expected something similar to Harari but I was pleasantly surprised. Only the language and rigor left something to be desired, but that's something I can hardly hold against it.
### Pandemic! - Slavoj Žižek

### Marx, Capital and the Madness of Economic Reason - David Harvey
### China: A History - John Keay
### The State and Revolution - Vladimir Lenin
### Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race - Reni Eddo-Lodge
### Sad by Design - Geert Lovink
### Ten Arguments For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now - Jaron Lanier
### Ze zijn ons vergeten - Peter Mertens
