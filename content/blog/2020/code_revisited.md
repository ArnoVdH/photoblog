I've built this website almost a year ago during the summer days. This year, the summer arrived two months earlier than it is supposed to and this takes me back mentally to those days. Maybe that's why I've been looking into the behind-the-screens mess that this blog is. First lesson learned: letting things lie for long times will make it more difficult to pick things up where you left them. Who would've thought?

There are still some things I want to fix and implement on this website, while also keeping it simple and light. I'll try and explain what and how in this post.

## Things I'd like to achieve with these updates
* introduce lazyloading and responsive images to make the photography pages *a lot* faster to load
* add a dropdown 'about' menu in the header; possible reworking the header system completely to utilize huog's capabilities more
* re-style blogpost images to be more consistent
* built a way to make photo posts easier, using a function to range over the images and/or the concept of page bundles in hugo
* Reach a state that I could describe as being fully functional (version 1.0)

All changes will also be documented on the [approriate page](/version)

## The idea of light-weight, susstainable webdesign
Resources, CO2 emissions from websites
Countered by low-tech solutions: static pages, no trackers etc, default fonts, lightweight images (haven't done that one yet)
