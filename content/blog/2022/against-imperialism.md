* We _shouldn't_ engage with warmongering and imperialist discourse or encourage such policies
* We _should_ help the Ukrainians

There's a tendency in these fraught times to view these two as mutually exclusive, or even as pro-either-side-of-the-conflict. This is blatantly false.

This isn't the same as neutrality though. Many countries in the West are incapable of being neutral in this conflict because of NATO membership, which makes it difficult as a citizen of any of these countries to have a truly neutral position. Anyone claiming otherwise would probably better be described as a cynic than anything else.
