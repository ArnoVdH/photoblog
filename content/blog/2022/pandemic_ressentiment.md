+++
A year ago I wrote a blogpost on the impact of the pandemic, a month into the (what we now know to be the first) lockdown. Back then, the situation was unprecedented for our generation and the measures taken quite drastic. But by now the situation has evolved; there is no longer talk about 'flattening the curve' or 'we're all in this together'

Societal resentment is a huge problem

We shouldn't lose track of our fundamental rights

There are victims of the crisis, and profiteers. There are no winners.
