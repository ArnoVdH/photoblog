Why I am a member of a Communist Party

In this post I won't be explaining why I think communism is right, or expound on in-depth theory about historical necessity or what have you. Here I'm just going to explain what my personal reasons are for joining and participating in my local party - being the Workers' Party of Belgium or the PVDA-PTB (Partij van de Arbeid van BelgiÃ« - Parti du Travail de Belgique).

I joined the Party the day of the local elections in 2018. Before that, I liked the Party and had friends who were member, but always declined to join, partly because of my own political-philosophical background and a reluctance to commit to a political program. After joining, I quickly decided to become a member of a local group\[^1\].

Initially, it was mainly about my decision to commit to the party program and accepting the compromise between my own political views and them. Thinking it more important to give critical support to a much needed socialist party in our country than nitpicking about details or differences of opinion.

But as with a lot of things in life, my reasons to do something changed over time. While, yes, I have some different opinions on quite a lot of subjects with the Party, I also learned a lot.

In 2021 there was the Party Congress that is being held every five years - delayed by one year because of the pandemic. I wasn't elected to go to the committees and the Congress itself was held with a limited audience and livestreamed, but I did read the text that was published. 

\[^1\]: Membership in the party is split up in three levels where the expected commitment goes up: advisory members, local group members and militants.
