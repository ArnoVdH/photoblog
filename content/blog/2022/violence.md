Pacifism and violent society

Intro

<!--more-->

### The morality of violence

Let's make one thing clear: violence is morally bad. Inflicting pain or damage is, generally, worse than refraining from it. Most frameworks of morality, be they religious, philosophical or even just intuitive-emotional, agree on this. From _you shall not kill_  from the Mosaic commandments or Christ's _Do unto others as you would have them do unto you_, to Kant's maxims, it is 

But this gets complicated rather quickly as soon as you delve a little deeper. What if there is already some other violence involved in the equation? What if there's something else than just interpersonal, physical violence?
