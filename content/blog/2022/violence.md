Intro

<!--more-->

Violence is morally bad

Violence is a necessary component of normal society

We need to be able to think about violence

Not doing this is opening oneself up to being taken by surprise, falling to inaction & defeat.

Some circumstances could allow to use of violence

There are states of exception where the normal use of violence is suspended and extraordinary rules and logic may apply
