I was originally planning on doing the Trans-Siberian and Trans-Mongolian express this winter, but due to the ongoing pandemic that plan fell through. To console myself I decided to redirect the money planned for this into a new pc build. This will be the first time actually building one myself from scratch.

I've waited for the new generation of AMD cpu's and gpu's for this build. Good thing too, since running them both is supposed to deliver a significant boost in performance due to it's new *smart access memory* buzzword. We'll see about that.

I'm also choosing for a (somewhat) small form-factor pc (sffpc), RGP lightning and a liquid cooler. Now that I have the money for it, I'd like to make my inner teenage gamer happy.
