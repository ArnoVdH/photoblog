I was originally planning on doing the Trans-Siberian and Trans-Mongolian express this winter, but due to the ongoing pandemic that plan fell through. To console (pun!) myself I decided to redirect the money planned for this into a new pc build. This will be the first time actually building one myself from scratch.

I've waited for the new generation of AMD cpu's and gpu's for this build. This turned out to be somewhat of a mistake. Because of this perfect storm - a pandemic impacting every part of the production and supply chain, a huge increase in demand because of all the work-from-home-jobs and quarantines and a coincidental spike in cryptocurrency mining profitability - it has been difficult to get my hands on some components, mainly the gpu.

When, after months of waiting, the components had finally arrived, I spent a few days building and installing the pc. It was a bit of a puzzle, but I was very happy that the machine booted correctly on the first try!
