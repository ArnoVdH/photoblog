title = "Building a new pc"

+++
I was originally planning on doing the Trans-Siberian and Trans-Mongolian express this winter, but due to the ongoing pandemic that plan fell through. To console myself I decided to redirect the money planned for this into a new pc build. This will be the first time actually building one myself from scratch.

I've waited for the new generation of AMD cpu's and gpu's for this build. This turned out to be a mistake. There's a perfect storm of problems in production and distribution and a huge increase in demand due to more time (and work) at home and a spike in cryptocurrency prices, that makes getting your hands on some components very difficult. It took me around five months to get everything together, I spent quite a bit more than expected and didn't get to game during the christmas holidays on my new system because of this.

But when I got everything together, I had a lot of fun with figuring out how it all fit together. Spend two days tinkering and retrying some things now and then. It was't the easiest because I chose a somewhat smaller form factor pc to build (half as big as my last case!) but in the end I have a smooth looking machine, humming every so silently at my desk.

### Components

* Case: Cooler Master NR200P
* Motherboard: Gigabyte X570 I Aorus pro wifi (Mini ITX)
* CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5800X
* RAM: 2x G. Skill DDR4 Trident-Z 16GB 3600Mhz
* GPU: AMD Radeon 6900 XT
* Storage: Samsung 970 EVO M.2 SSD 1TB
* Cooling: Noctua NH-U9S Chromax.Black
* PSU: Cooler Master V750 SFX Gold
* Monitor: LG 27GL850 27" (1440p, 144Hz) + Philips 272B 27" (1440p, 75Hz)

### Software

I decided to ditch Manjaro and switch to Arch itself, the base for Manjaro anyway.  Manjaro was not as stable as I liked it to be, and the updates in the repositories came quite slow and not at all in sync with eachother. The same problem exists in Arch, but that's expected, unlike with Manjaro.
