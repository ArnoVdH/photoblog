My yearly retrospective on the books I read, general impressions they left on me (if any of note). 

<!--more-->

* **The Age of Surveillance Capitalism** - Shoshana Zuboff
* **1491** - Charles C. Mann
* **Cannibalism** - Bill Schutt
* **Can Political Violence Ever Be Justified?** - Elizabeth Frazer & Kimberly Hutchings

  Short and clear overview of some of the different theories on political violence. I don't necessarily agree with their conclusion that, in the end, it's never justified, but the overview is definitely worth the read.
* **The Civil War in France** - Karl Marx
* **The Old Is Dying and the New Cannot Be Born** - Nancy Fraser

  The first of two Gramscian analyses I read this year on our current hegemonic period of struggle, mostly focussing on the American case. Inspiring in how to think about the advent and meaning of 'neoliberalism'.
* **The Lost Revolution** - Chris Harman

  Trotskyite history of the German Revolution.
* **Left-Wing Communism, an Infantile Disorder** - Vladimir Lenin

  Post-revolution essay dealing with the left-wing adversaries, both inside Russia as internationally. Interesting as a historical document but in the end not as poignant as his other works.
* **Starry Speculative Corpse** (Horror of Philosophy 2) - Eugene Thacker

  Inspiring account of negative philosophy and the concept of 'nothing'. Thacker shows an openness often lacking towards the religious and non-Western. Although ultimately, it's more of an aesthetic appreciation for the dark, morbid and negative that is being explored, rather than a real philosophical defense, it's a recommended read for those so inclined (such as myself).
* **Vooruit!** - Ico Maly

  A critique of the new direction of the Belgian social-democratic party in three parts: 1) the role of social media in the political landscape (the first writer in the Dutch language area who seems to _get it_); 2) the restyling of the party to _Vooruit_ and it's attempt to re-invent the socialist brand; and 3) the figure of Connor Rousseau himself. He is highly critical of it's so-called socialism and drawing interesting analogies to the socialism being promoted by the Belgian interbellum figure Henri De Man.
* **De Bourgondiërs** - Bart van Loo

  A whimsical history of the Northren Burgundians masquarading as a venerable tome. It's... okay, at best. There are some interesting tidbits and a general historical overview of the Burgundian state, but the author embellishes needlessly and focusses too much on the dynastic side of things, while neglecting the material, everyday realities.
* **Breaking Things at Work** - Gavin Mueller
* **Strange Histories** - Darren Oldridge
* **Atomic Habits** - James Clear
* **The Great Railway Bazaar** - Paul Theroux
* **Virtue and Terror** - Maximilien Robespierre & Slavoj Žižek
* **Washington Bullets** - Vijay Prashad

  Lots of interesting facts and critiques and insights about the history of Western imperialism, that seem to lack any coherency in its writing. Prashad seems to be a better speaker than writer. Still, it was a worthwhile read.
* **Under the Black Flag** - David Cordingly

  A general overview of piracy in the West-Indies and all the important piracy tropes. A fun read, nothing too heavy.
* **Why Women Have Better Sex Under Socialism** - Kristen Ghodsee
* **Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master** - Michael Shea
* **For a Left Populism** - Chantal Mouffe
