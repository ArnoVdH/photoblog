There's a weird paradox going on in the idea of free/libre material (both software as other creative content). According to something like the Creative Commons license, the more you allow others to do with your material, the freer it is *even if this means that those using it may limit subsequent usage*.

### Multiple types of freedom
The free/libre idea, as with most Anglo-American ideas, have a singular focus on what's called 'negative freedom' in philosophy; the *absense* of limitations on something. But there's also 'positive freedom', which is the presence of possibilities and means to achieve them.

### Non-commercialism
I get where the idea comes from, but it irks me to no end. In a strict sense it is true that allowing for commercial use is more free than restricting it: less limitations = more negative freedom and it doesn't inhibit it's non-commercial use. But commercialisation of freely provided material could be seen as exploitative in certain situations - although not necessiraly so. 

### Share-alike
I'd argue that a share-alike license is actually *more* free than one that doesn't have this clause.
