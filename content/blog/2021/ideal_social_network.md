The _nillies_ has been the decade of social media. From initial novelty to the digital equivalent of low-yield nuclear ICBM's. The analogy is maybe a bit over dramatic, but it's potential as a weapon has been demonstrated already. During these ten years, it has taken root almost everywhere on the globe. When older people started accepting it - and youngsters subsequently started to reject it in rebellion - was when it went from new frontier to established, settled fact.

I, too, was smitten by the ideas, rapidly accepting it as part of my (then fresh) university life.  But with growing awareness, both from myself as from society at large, about these social networks, their workings, consequences and ideology, came a desire, not to return to an earlier internet, but for a different way to do social networking. In this blogpost I'll try to explain my personal vision as a non-technical layman on what such a network would look like, where we can find existing inspiration and what pitfalls I think are to be avoided.

### Inspiration

The web isn't young or new anymore, how hard its sleek, turtlenecked proponents pretend it still is. There's a lot of material to work with here, technologies that have proven themselves, communities and sites that have come and gone, a whole legacy to build on. There's also some missed opportunities to embed certain technologies into the basic protocols that govern the web and that is something we have to deal with and be wary of for future development of the internet.

Somewhat before my time, but at the same moment, still one of the most basic forms of the internet, are personal websites. From basic HTML sites from the nineties, to GeoCities and basic blogging platforms, these gave you the tools to make your personal presence on the web.  This ideal of 'having your own place' seems to have faded and exchanged for a uniform experience for everyone. Even early social networking sites, such as MySpace, took their cues from the early web and let you make your own page, with obnoxious music that started playing automatically and garish backgrounds. These days, the personalisation is limited to strictly defined things such as an avatar, a profile banner (with specified dimensions) and maybe, if you're lucky, a background image.

One of the biggest successes of the dynamic 'Web 2.0' (as opposed to the earlier, static web) was WordPress, an free and open-source content management system that took the world by storm and actually drives around half of the websites even to this day. It's a great tool to build and manage a website, to be sure, but one of the most interesting features is its extensibility.

To me personally, one of the biggest inspirations was Tumblr. A (micro)blogging site that gave you a dashboard to scroll through all your subscribed to pages and a personal page that you could customize but filled automatically with your content - both original as 'reblogged' (content from other people you republished on your own page with a link back and sometimes with commentary). These personal pages were reminiscent of those earlier personal webpages. But I think my favorite feature is the simple follow button on these pages. Unobtrusive, this little button in the corner of the page is an aspiration for how both the 'old' personal websites and the 'new' social networks can be linked to each other.

More modern inspiration can be found in the Fediverse (federated networks), such as the Mastodon platform. This is a method of networking where not everything happens on the same website (such as is the case on all major websites with networking functions) but through a shared protocol. This way, different websites, with different goals, rules, communities, style or even (back-end) software can communicate with each other, freeing people from the restrictions of having only one such platform and even giving the possibility (but not necessity) of self-hosting.

### Must-have elements

Some sort of federation.
Open-source.
Modular, extensible, customizable.
Ease-of-access.  
Data sovereignty

### What is to be avoided

Commercialism embedded into the core system.

(Forced) profile fragmentation, only limited to sensible compartmentalization.
