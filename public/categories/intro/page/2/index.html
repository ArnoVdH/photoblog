<p>It started out as an idea to have my own place on the internet.</p>

<p><strong>Goal: a clean, light website that functions as both a photo portfolio and a personal blog. Building it myself would be an added bonus.</strong></p>

<h2 id="early-2019-exploring-possibilities">Early 2019: exploring possibilities</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have any background in graphic or web design or programming. Building my own website is a personal challenge and learning experience</p>

<p>I started by researching a bit generally about webdesign, html &amp; css (internetting is not hard and other guides).</p>

<p>At first I looked into building with wordpress, since it&rsquo;s so ubiquitous on the internet, well documented and accessible. But when I tried to run a local version to build my own site, I encountered loads of problems that were pretty hard to fix.</p>

<p>Wordpress also felt cumbersome. A friend told me about looking into static website generators and he himself was dabbling with Jekyll. When researching this I found Hugo and decided to try it out since it&rsquo;s simplicity of needing only one binary. Very easy to set up and start building.</p>

<h2 id="summer-2019-building-with-hugo">Summer 2019: Building with Hugo</h2>

<p>In early july I built my hugo setup on a laptop with Lubuntu, VS Code and GitHub.</p>

<p>After some tinkering with other theme&rsquo;s and trying to figure out how everything connected, I decided to build my own theme from the ground up. Making it unnecessarily complicated for myself, according to some, but a fun free-time project according to myself.</p>

<p>Funfact: I&rsquo;m writing this blogpost while I&rsquo;m still building the website. I literally have just a basic skeleton of the site and I&rsquo;m starting to get a feel for the whole thing. Things are becoming clearer and specific issues are being identified. Progress at last! It makes me happy.</p>

<p>The first two weeks were mainly spent building the html-side of the site, until I got it mostly functional. I would return to it regularly to change functionalities or fix mistakes, but I got most of it working. The css part of it all brought numerous new problems to light, forced me to reconsider certain choices and slowed progress down. But I kept tinkering and progress continued. (You can read a bit more about some of the design decisions and fixes I made <a href="/blog/2019/07/solving-the-code/">here</a>)</p>
